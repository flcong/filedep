# Change Log

## 0.0.4 (2022-02-07)

* The previous version requires that the last modified date of the code file be later than that of the input data sets. However, this is unnecessary since the input data sets may be modified without the need to change the code file. In this case, we only need to check if all output data sets are modified after that of the changed input data set.

## 0.0.3 (2022-01-24)

* Allow the first and third element in the list to be empty.
